  A localization server at penguin.ctf.jumpwire.ai will encrypt and return the flag on request. The developers wanted to make sure it was future-proof for any l10n needs, so it accepts input for how to describe the data being returned - not all languages would call it a flag, after all.

  Connect to the server with either TLS or plain TCP:

  ```
  socat - OPENSSL:penguin.ctf.jumpwire.ai:31337
  socat - TCP:penguin.ctf.jumpwire.ai:1337
  ```
