  We received a cellphone that was part of Mugjournal's skunkworks lab. Apparently it used to be on a secret network before it was smuggled out - find out what that network is!

  Hint: The target phone has a MAC address of 8c:45:00:70:33:7a and is powered on at our booth. No physical access is allowed, but getting close should be enough.
