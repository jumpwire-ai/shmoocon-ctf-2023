  The European Data Protection Board has created a chat room for individuals to ask questions directly to representatives of the EU national data protection authorities (national Supervisory Authorities). If all representatives are busy, an automated bot will provide responses from a pre-generated list of answers. The EDPB aims to best serve all constituents of the EU.

  You can access the chatbot at https://bot-script.ctf.jumpwire.ai
